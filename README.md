# GraphQL Profile Page

The objective of this project is to learn the GraphQL query language, by creating your own profile page.

You'll use the GraphQL endpoint which is provided by the platform. You'll be able to query your own data to populate your profile page.

So that you can access your data, you'll need to create a login page.

Your profile must display three pieces of information which you may choose. For example:

Basic user identification
XP amount
grades
audits
skills
Beside those sections it will have a mandatory section for the generation of statistic graphs.

Access the application in your browser at `https://schanaDev.github.io /`.
